# Protect Toronto’s Public Transit from A Ridership Death Spiral

_An Open Letter to Federal, Provincial, and Municipal Governments_

We the undersigned — a collection of researchers and experts from around the Greater Toronto Area — are calling on municipal, provincial, and federal governments to protect the city’s incredibly vital public transit system from harmful and unproductive cuts to service.

In response to a budget shortfall, the Toronto Transit Commission [has proposed](https://ttc-cdn.azureedge.net/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Public-Meetings/Board/2023/January-9/1_2023_TTC_Conventional_and_Wheel_Trans_Operating_Budgets.pdf?rev=1d65ed1418374527b7479584a9a06445&hash=FB374C8ACB097C89E89B3409A45154B6) a 9% service reduction compared to pre-pandemic levels. This includes moving to 10-minute wait times on the subway network at some times of day and compromises the city’s “10 minute network” of frequent bus service. These cuts to service are likely to initiate a ridership [death spiral](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2021/10/06/its-too-much-of-a-risk-riders-left-the-ttc-in-droves-over-covid-19-could-that-trigger-a-public-transit-death-spiral.html) in which long wait time and poorer service leads to ridership drops, which in turn lead to further revenue losses and cuts.

Instead of forcing our nation’s largest transit system to rely so heavily on fares and ridership to operate, **we call for the implementation of alternative revenue sources across all three levels of government to prevent this downward slide**. A transit death spiral now will have the grave consequences for the city, province, and country:



* **More congestion:** The TTC’s Line 1 regularly carries the equivalent of 26 highway lanes of people directly into the downtown core of Canada’s largest city. Longer waits and fewer trains will push more people towards driving, increasing congestion in a city already ranked[ 3rd most congested](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/01/12/toronto-ranks-one-of-the-worst-worldwide-for-traffic-congestion-report-finds.html) in North America. 
* **A weaker economy**Studies place the cost of congestion in the GTA between [$3.3](https://cutaactu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/uttf-congestion-2012.pdf) and [$6](https://www.cdhowe.org/sites/default/files/attachments/research_papers/mixed/Commentary_385_0.pdf) billion per year. This cost will increase as more riders switch to driving. 
* **Dirtier air, poorer health, and more traffic deaths**: Transit produces significantly [less air pollution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210670718302026?via%3Dihub) per rider than private cars in the region, including pollutants that [reduce life expectancy](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c07639). Cities with higher transit ridership also have [fewer traffic deaths](https://doi.org/10.1177/0361198105193000103) per capita. 
* **Undermined equity goals**: Transit riders will struggle more to complete daily life activities. Many Torontonians, especially those belonging to equity seeking groups, rely on transit to access[ healthcare and prescriptions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140521001420),[ groceries](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944363.2021.1886974), work, and other essential services. For example, newcomers are[ more likely to rely on transit](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000080) for[ daily activities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140521001420), and the federal government[ plans](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2022/11/an-immigration-plan-to-grow-the-economy.html) to admit more than 500,000 permanent residents annually by 2025.
* **Undermined housing goals**: Toronto is [planning for](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2023/cc/bgrd/backgroundfile-230423.pdf) more affordable and market rate housing. Planning to build more housing while cutting local transit service will lead to crowding on transit and give existing residents more motivation to oppose new housing. 
* **Undermined climate goals**: Canada [plans](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/climate-plan-overview/emissions-reduction-2030.html) to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Transit in the region produces dramatically [lower emissions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210670718302026?via%3Dihub) per rider compared to private cars. Riders switching to driving will undermine our efforts to achieve net zero.
* **Less return on infrastructure investments:** All three levels of governments have poured billions of dollars into expanding the city’s network. Some examples include the Ontario Line, Eglinton Crosstown, Scarborough Subway Extension, Yonge North Subway Extension, and more. If the bus system [supporting these rail lines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418300296) is diminished, then the benefits promised by these investments will not materialize.

We recognize that transit demand is at a crossroads, and so our ask means fully funding a system that looks under-utilized compared to the recent past. **But how policymakers respond to the lingering effect of the pandemic is what will actually determine whether the pandemic was a brief shock to our transit system or the beginning of its demise.**

Leaders in other cities across the world have recognized this choice and have decided to double down on a transit-oriented future. Washington D.C. is [winning back riders](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2022/12/12/free-ride-dc-unveils-bold-plan-to-boost-public-transit/) by pairing enhanced service with the elimination of fares. Closer to home, Brampton Transit is [exceeding pre-pandemic ridership levels](https://www.brampton.ca/EN/residents/transit/About-Us/Pages/Ridership.aspx) by maintaining and expanding frequent and connected service.

Meanwhile, Canada’s largest city is on track to rob current and future Torontonians of a sustainable, equitable, and liveable future.

We strongly urge governments to adopt progressive policies that can shore up transit service in the nation’s largest city (and elsewhere) until ridership recovers. Below we provide a list of options that, in some combination, could easily offset planned cuts, while providing co-benefits across social, environmental, and economic goals for a sustainable and vibrant future:  

**City**



* A [commercial parking levy](https://www.torontoenvironment.org/fund_ttc_parking_2023budget#:~:text=A%20commercial%20parking%20levy%20is,fund%20the%20TTC%20%5B1%5D.). World-class cities from New York to Sydney apply commercial parking levies to fund transit and other green infrastructure. 
* Expedite implementation of [RapidTO](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/transportation-projects/rapidto/rapidto-bus-lanes/) transit right-of-way projects, especially along major surface corridors that were carrying 15,000 passengers or more in 2019.
* Scale down planned expenditures on [Gardiner Expressway rehabilitation work](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/02/15/matt-elliott-gardiner-expressway-looms-large-as-toronto-debates-budget-but-few-at-city-hall-want-to-talk-about-it.html') and move funding to transit operations instead.

**Province** 

* [Increase](https://news.ontario.ca/en/backgrounder/1001445/2021-22-gas-tax-funding-by-municipality) the amount of existing gasoline tax revenue dedicated to public transit from 2 cents to 4 cents under the _Dedicated Funding for Public Transit Act._
* Fully fund an integrated fare system for the GTA.
* Allow the City of Toronto to raise revenues from tolling the DVP and Gardiner Expressway or implementing other congestion charges.
* Develop and implement a rational 400 series tolling system. 

**Federal government**

* Establish a dedicated funding program for public transit operations similar to Ontario’s _Dedicated Funding for Public Transit Act_.
* Federal funding for transit and affordable housing should be provided within an integrated funding framework.

Failure to act now will throw the future of public transit in Toronto into jeopardy as the region grows by almost [3 million people](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-population-projections) over the coming decades. We call on all levels of government to protect Toronto’s transportation backbone and stop these cuts.
